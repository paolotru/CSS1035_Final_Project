# Secure Software Development (CSS1035) - Final Group Project 

Project developed in a team of three people during my Mobility Program for one semester at St.John's University in New York.


The project consisted in developing a small Banking application while taking the following steps:

- Designing the program solution to use secure coding guidelines, including security requirements
- Implementing code to use defensive programming techniques
- Using defensive principles of input validation and output encoding
- Applying cryptographic constructions to ensure confidentiality of data at rest or in transit
